#### ðŸ‘‹ **About Me**  
<p align = "justify">
Hello, I'm Smarth Kaushal, pursuing my graduation in Computer Science and Engineering, at Thapar Institute of Engineering & Technology, Patiala. I view technology as a divine gift, and true innovation emerges when technology intersects with creativity, the arts, and human values. This fusion results in solutions that not only solve problems but also resonate deeply with the human spirit.
</p>

#### ðŸŒŸ **What Drives Me**
<p align = "justify">
I believe in the power of technology to shape a better future. For me, coding is not just a professionâ€”itâ€™s a craft where creativity meets logic to deliver meaningful results. I am constantly learning to master the tools and technologies available to create harmonious solutions, much like a violinist perfects their craft to produce beautiful music. With every new technology, I strive to find my unique melody in the world of innovation.
